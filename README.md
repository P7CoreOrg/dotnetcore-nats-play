NATS Playground

In the solution folder run the following command
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
To verify that it is up navigate [http://localhost:8222/](http://localhost:8222/)  

The examples, which I copied from [nats.net](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.net) assume the standard ports (4222) which you can override.
